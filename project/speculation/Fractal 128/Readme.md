Fractal search for more stable crystal as explained in the assignement
Compuation with
K=1
ecutwfc=54,
ecutrho=432,

Computation failed on my own computer

Files:
1. fractal.cif: file 
2. fractal.in: vsc computation
3. run.pbs: script to run job in VSC with PBS (VUB cluster)

Results (1 node 32 cores):

1. With K=2, ecutwfc= 54, ecutrho=432 => hit walltime 23hr => 1 iterations
1. With K=1, ecutwfc= 54, ecutrho=432 => hit walltime 13hr => 2 iterations
3. With K=1, ecutwfc= 27, ecutrho=216 =>  Currently running on my laptop 
3. With K=1, ecutwfc= 27, ecutrho=216 =>  Currently running on vsc
