# How I created the files

## professorfractal
Ok so i just did an expansion of DO3 into a cube of 2x2x2 DO3's i.e
a unit cell of 128 atoms, then (if you draw this out, it's easier to
understand) I changed all the Si atoms to iron who are in the cubes
for which x>=0.5 and z >=0.5 (this is the case for 4 of the 8 cubes
making the required pyramid like shape [I don't remember the sciency
word used]). This gives 16 Si atoms in the unit cell, as requested.

## MoreFractal
Now, I didn't think it looked like a fractal at all the above
(I couldn't recognize the DO3's), so I tweaked it a bit,
it now contains 22 atoms of Si per 128 atoms, which is 
17.1875% which is coincidentally close to a tenth of the golden
ratio so maybe we're onto something (or I'm just hoping for
a miracle ðŸ« )
