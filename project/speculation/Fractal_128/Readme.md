Fractal search for more stable crystal as explained in the assignement
Compuation with
K=1
ecutwfc=54,
ecutrho=432,

Computation failed on my own computer

Files:
1. fractal.cif: file 
2. fractal.in: vsc computation
3. run.pbs: script to run job in VSC with PBS (VUB cluster)

Results are visible in .out file. The name is fractal-kvalue-ecutrho_value-ecutwfc_value.out
